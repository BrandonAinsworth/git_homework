Main Takeaways:

Session 1: Turing requires dedication and a well-thought out plan for success

Session 2: Be honest with yourself, and make sure to give yourself everything that you need to be successful. Do not try to be perfect, nobody is!

Strategies to Try:

- The Pomodoro method seems practical for use during the Mod 0 project as to not get overwhelmed.

- Scheduling time for wellness, it is easy for me to sit down and stare at the screen forever and I know I will use the project as a subconscious excuse to skip things like the gym and meditation which will be more helpful then ever during Turing.

Shoutouts:

Shoutout to Amy and Chelsea Stallings!ðŸ¥³ They have been nothing but supportive in helping me smoothly navigate my transition to Turing!
